Task 3: Develop an ontology

*categories apply to both mcgill and concordia datasets

1.	Start by going through all the posts and putting down the category that “seems right to you”
2.	Review all the “categories” that you put down. You might have a lot. Consolidate them down to 5-15 categories.
    these categories were as follows:
        - exams, student clubs, news, courses, tuition hike, jobs, israel/palestine, rent, exchange, locations, admissions, program requirements, technical issues, services
3.	Go back through an annotate posts again using just those ones. Keep track of any issues you encountered.
    these issues were as follows:
    - some of the tags were too specific
    - some of the titles are extremely ambiguous - we have no idea what will be discussed in the content of the post

4.	Based on your experience with the second round, tighten up the categories one more time so that you have the 5-8 in your typology. (if you’re not there yet, just repeat steps 3 & 4 again, possibly a couple times)
    the final categories are as follows:
    - exams, student clubs, courses, tuition hike, jobs, admissions, miscellaneous
